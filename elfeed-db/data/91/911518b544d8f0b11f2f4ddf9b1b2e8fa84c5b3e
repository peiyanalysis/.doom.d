<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3719/british-square">British Square</a> is a 1978 abstract strategy board game which I
recently discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PChKZbut3lM&amp;t=10m">from a YouTube video</a>. It’s well-suited to play
by pencil-and-paper, so my wife and I played a few rounds to try it out.
Curious about strategies, I searched online for analysis and found
nothing whatsoever, meaning I’d have to discover strategies for myself.
This is <em>exactly</em> the sort of problem that <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd snipes</a>, and so I
sunk a couple of evenings building an analysis engine in C — enough to
fully solve the game and play <em>perfectly</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Repository</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/british-square"><strong>British Square Analysis Engine</strong></a>
(and <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/british-square/releases">prebuilt binaries</a>)</p>

<p>The game is played on a 5-by-5 grid with two players taking turns
placing pieces of their color. Pieces may not be placed on tiles
4-adjacent to an opposing piece, and as a special rule, the first player
may not play the center tile on the first turn. Players pass when they
have no legal moves, and the game ends when both players pass. The score
is the difference between the piece counts for each player.</p>

<p>In the default configuration, my engine takes a few seconds to explore
the full game tree, then presents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax</a> values for the
current game state along with the list of perfect moves. The UI allows
manually exploring down the game tree. It’s intended for analysis, but
there’s enough UI present to “play” against the AI should you so wish.
For some of my analysis I made small modifications to the program to
print or count game states matching certain conditions.</p>

<h3 id="game-analysis">Game analysis</h3>

<p>Not accounting for symmetries, there are 4,233,789,642,926,592 possible
playouts. In these playouts, the first player wins 2,179,847,574,830,592
(~51%), the second player wins 1,174,071,341,606,400 (~28%), and the
remaining 879,870,726,489,600 (~21%) are ties. It’s immediately obvious
the first player has a huge advantage.</p>

<p>Accounting for symmetries, there are 8,659,987 total game states. Of
these, 6,955 are terminal states, of which the first player wins 3,599
(~52%) and the second player wins 2,506 (~36%). This small number of
states is what allows the engine to fully explore the game tree in a few
seconds.</p>

<p>Most importantly: <strong>The first player can always win by two points.</strong> In
other words, it’s <em>not</em> like Tic-Tac-Toe where perfect play by both
players results in a tie. Due to the two-point margin, the first player
also has more room for mistakes and usually wins even without perfect
play. There are fewer opportunities to blunder, and a single blunder
usually results in a lower win score. The second player has a narrow
lane of perfect play, making it easy to blunder.</p>

<p>Below is the minimax analysis for the first player’s options. The number
is the first player’s score given perfect play from that point — i.e.
perfect play starts on the tiles marked “2”, and the tiles marked “0”
are blunders that lead to ties.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>11111
12021
10-01
12021
11111
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The special center rule probably exists to reduce the first player’s
obvious advantage, but in practice it makes little difference. Without
the rule, the first player has an additional (fifth) branch for a win by
two points:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>11111
12021
10201
12021
11111
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Improved alternative special rule: <strong>Bias the score by two in favor of
the second player.</strong> This fully eliminates the first player’s advantage,
perfect play by both sides results in a tie, and both players have a
narrow lane of perfect play.</p>

<p>The four tie openers are interesting because the reasoning does not
require computer assistance. If the first player opens on any of those
tiles, the second player can mirror each of the first player’s moves,
guaranteeing a tie. Note: The first player can still make mistakes that
results in a second player win <em>if</em> the second player knows when to stop
mirroring.</p>

<p>One of my goals was to develop a heuristic so that even human players
can play perfectly from memory, as in Tic-Tac-Toe. Unfortunately I was
not able to develop any such heuristic, though I <em>was</em> able to prove
that <strong>a greedy heuristic — always claim as much territory as possible —
is often incorrect</strong> and, in some cases, leads to blunders.</p>

<h3 id="engine-implementation">Engine implementation</h3>

<p>As <a href="/blog/2017/04/27/">I’ve done before</a>, my engine represents the game using
<a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards">bitboards</a>. Each player has a 25-bit bitboard representing their
pieces. To make move validation more efficient, it also sometimes tracks
a “mask” bitboard where invalid moves have been masked. Updating all
bitboards is cheap (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">place()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mask()</code>), as is validating moves
against the mask (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">valid()</code>).</p>

<p>The longest possible game is 32 moves. This would <em>just</em> fit in 5 bits,
except that I needed a special “invalid” turn, making it a total of 33
bits. So I use 6 bits to store the turn counter.</p>

<p>Besides generally being unnecessary, the validation masks can be derived
from the main bitboards, so I don’t need to store them in the game tree.
That means I need 25 bits per player, and 6 bits for the counter: <strong>56
bits total</strong>. I pack these into a 64-bit integer. The first player’s
bitboard goes in the bottom 25 bits, the second player in the next 25
bits, and the turn counter in the topmost 6 bits. The turn counter
starts at 1, so an all zero state is invalid. I exploit this in the hash
table so that zeroed slots are empty (more on this later).</p>

<p>In other words, the <em>empty</em> state is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x4000000000000</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INIT</code>) and zero
is the null (invalid) state.</p>

<p>Since the state is so small, rather than passing a pointer to a state to
be acted upon, bitboard functions return a new bitboard with the
requested changes… functional style.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="minimax-costs">Minimax costs</h4>

<p>The engine uses minimax to propagate information up the tree. Since the
search extends to the very bottom of the tree, the minimax “heuristic”
evaluation function is the actual score, not an approximation, which is
why it’s able to play perfectly.</p>

<p>When <a href="/blog/2010/10/17/">I’ve used minimax before</a>, I built an actual tree data
structure in memory, linking states by pointer / reference. In this
engine there is no such linkage, and instead the links are computed
dynamically via the validation masks. Storing the pointers is more
expensive than computing their equivalents on the fly, <em>so I don’t store
them</em>. Therefore my game tree only requires 56 bits per node — or 64
bits in practice since I’m using a 64-bit integer. With only 8,659,987
nodes to store, that’s a mere 66MiB of memory! This analysis could have
easily been done on commodity hardware two decades ago.</p>

<p>What about the minimax values? Game scores range from -10 to 11: 22
distinct values. (That the first player can score up to 11 and the
second player at most 10 is another advantage to going first.) That’s 5
bits of information. However, I didn’t have this information up front,
and so I assumed a range from -25 to 25, which requires 6 bits.</p>

<p>There are still 8 spare bits left in the 64-bit integer, so I use 6 of
them for the minimax score. Rather than worry about two’s complement, I
bias the score to eliminate negative values before storing it. So the
minimax score rides along for free above the state bits.</p>

<h4 id="hash-table-memoization">Hash table (memoization)</h4>

<p>The vast majority of game tree branches are redundant. Even without
taking symmetries into account, nearly all states are reachable from
multiple branches. Exploring all these redundant branches would take
centuries. If I run into a state I’ve seen before, I don’t want to
recompute it.</p>

<p>Once I’ve computed a result, I store it in a hash table so that I can
find it later. Since the state is just a 64-bit integer, I use <a href="/blog/2018/07/31/">an
integer hash function</a> to compute a starting index from which to
linearly probe an open addressing hash table. The <em>entire</em> hash table
implementation is literally a dozen lines of code:</p>

        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the bitboard is not found, it returns a pointer to the (zero-valued)
slot where it should go so that the caller can fill it in.</p>

<h4 id="canonicalization">Canonicalization</h4>

<p>Memoization eliminates nearly all redundancy, but there’s still a major
optimization left. Many states are equivalent by symmetry or reflection.
Taking that into account, about 7/8th of the remaining work can still be
eliminated.</p>

<p>Multiple different states that are identical by symmetry must to be
somehow “folded” into a single, <em>canonical</em> state to represent them all.
I do this by visiting all 8 rotations and reflections and choosing the
one with the smallest 64-bit integer representation.</p>

<p>I only need two operations to visit all 8 symmetries, and I chose
transpose (flip around the diagonal) and vertical flip. Alternating
between these operations visits each symmetry. Since they’re bitboards,
transforms can be implemented using <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Flipping_Mirroring_and_Rotating">fancy bit-twiddling hacks</a>.
Chess boards, with their power-of-two dimensions, have useful properties

<p>These transform both players’ bitboards in parallel while leaving the
turn counter intact. The logic here is quite simple: Shift the bitboard
a little bit at a time while using a mask to deposit bits in their new
home once they’re lined up. It’s like a coin sorter. Vertical flip is
analagous to byte-swapping, though with 5-bit “bytes”.</p>

<h3 id="developing-a-heuristic">Developing a heuristic</h3>

<p>If you can come up with a perfect play heuristic, especially one that
can be reasonably performed by humans, I’d like to hear it. My engine
has a built-in heuristic tester, so I can test it against perfect play
at all possible game positions to check that it actually works. It’s
currently programmed to test the greedy heuristic and print out the
millions of cases where it fails. Even a heuristic that fails in only a
small number of cases would be pretty reasonable.</p>
