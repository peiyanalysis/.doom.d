<p>We develop criteria based on a calibration argument via discrete PDE and
semidiscrete optimal transport, for finding sharp isoperimetric inequalities of
the form $(\sharp \Omega)^{d-1} \le C (\sharp
\overrightarrow{\partial\Omega})^d$ where $\Omega$ is a subset of vertices of a
graph and $\overrightarrow{\partial\Omega}$ is the oriented edge-boundary of
$\Omega$, as well as the optimum isoperimetric shapes $\Omega$. The method is a
discrete counterpart to Optimal Transport and ABP method proofs valid in the
continuum, and answers a question appearing in Hamamuki \cite{hamamuki},
extending that work valid for rectangular grids, to a larger class of graphs,
including graphs dual to simplicial meshes of equal volume. We also connect the
problem to the theory Voronoi tessellations and of Aleksandrov solutions from
semidiscrete optimal transport. The role of the geometric-arithmetic inequality
that was used in previous works in the continuum case and in the $\mathbb
Z^d$-graph case is now played by a geometric cell-optimization constant, where
the optimization problem is like in Minkowski's proof of his classical theorem
for convex polyhedra. Finally, we study the optimal constant in the related
discrete Neumann boundary problem, and present a series of possible directions
for a further classification of discrete edge-isoperimetric constants and
shapes.
