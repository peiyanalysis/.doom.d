<p>We study existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of the Dirichlet
problem related to fractional Dirichlet energy minimizers in a complete
doubling metric measure space $(X,d_X,\mu_X)$ satisfying a $2$-Poincar\'e
inequality. Given a bounded domain $\Omega\subset X$ with
$\mu_X(X\setminus\Omega)&gt;0$, and a function $f$ in the Besov class
$B^\theta_{2,2}(X)\cap L^2(X)$, we study the problem of finding a function
$u\in B^\theta_{2,2}(X)$ such that $u=f$ in $X\setminus\Omega$ and
$\mathcal{E}_\theta(u,u)\le \mathcal{E}_\theta(h,h)$ whenever $h\in
B^\theta_{2,2}(X)$ with $h=f$ in $X\setminus\Omega$. We show that such a
solution always exists and that this solution is unique. We also show that the
solution is locally H\"older continuous on $\Omega$, and satisfies a non-local
maximum and strong maximum principle. Part of the results in this paper extend
the work of Caffarelli and Silvestre in the Euclidean setting and Franchi and
Ferrari in Carnot groups.
