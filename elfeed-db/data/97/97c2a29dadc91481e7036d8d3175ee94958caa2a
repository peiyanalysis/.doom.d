<p>In the last years, a growing number of challenging applications in
navigation, logistics, and tourism were modeled as orienteering problems. This
problem has been proposed in relation to a sport race where certain control
points must be visited in a minimal time. In a certain kind of these
competitions, the choice of the number and the order for the control points are
left to the competitor. We propose an original approach to solve the
orienteering problem based on hybrid control. The continuous state of the
system contains information about the navigation toward the next control point.
In contrast, the discrete state keeps track of the already visited ones. The
control problem is solved using non-standard dynamical programming techniques.
