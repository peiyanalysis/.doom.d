<p>We construct smooth, non-symmetric plasma equilibria which possess closed,
nested flux surfaces and solve the magnetohydrostatic (steady three-dimensional
incompressible Euler) equations with a small force. The solutions are also
`nearly' quasisymmetric. The primary idea is, given a desired quasisymmetry
direction $\xi$, to change the smooth structure on space so that the vector
field $\xi$ is Killing for the new metric and construct $\xi$--symmetric
solutions of the magnetohydrostatic equations on that background by solving a
generalized Grad-Shafranov equation. If $\xi$ is close to a symmetry of
Euclidean space, then these are solutions on flat space up to a small forcing.
