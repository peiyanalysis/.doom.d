<p>We introduce the concept of intermittency dimension for the
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) to quantify the intermittency effect. With
dependence on the intermittency dimension, we derive phenomenological laws for
intermittent MHD turbulence with and without the Hall effect. In particular,
scaling laws of dissipation wavenumber, energy spectra and structure functions
are predicted. Moreover, we are able to provide estimates for energy spectra
and structure functions which are consistent with the predicted scalings.
