<p>In this paper, we study desingularization of vortices for the two-dimensional
incompressible Euler equations in the full plane. We construct a family of
steady vortex pairs for the Euler equations with a general vorticity function,
which constitutes a desingularization of a pair of point vortices with equal
magnitude and opposite signs. The results are obtained by using an improved
vorticity method.
