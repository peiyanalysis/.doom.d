<p>Given a link in the thickened annulus, its annular Khovanov homology carries
an action of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, which is natural with respect
to annular link cobordisms. We consider the problem of lifting this action to
the stable homotopy refinement of the annular homology. As part of this
program, the actions of the standard generators of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ are lifted
to maps of spectra. In particular, it follows that the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ action
on homology commutes with the action of the Steenrod algebra. The main new
technical ingredients developed in this paper, which may be of independent
interest, concern certain types of cancellations in the cube of resolutions and
the resulting more intricate structure of the moduli spaces in the framed flow
category.
