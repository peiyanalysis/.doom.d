<p>The ADO invariants are a sequence of non-semisimple quantum invariants coming
from the representation theory of the quantum group $U_q(sl(2))$ at roots of
unity. Ito showed that these invariants are sums of traces of quotients of
homological representations of braid groups (truncated Lawrence
representations). In this paper we show a direct homological formula for the
ADO invariants, as sums of partial traces of Lawrence type representations,
without further truncations.
