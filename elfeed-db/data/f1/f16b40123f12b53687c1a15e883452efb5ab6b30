<p>We introduce a parametric framework for the study of Willmore gradient flows
which enables to consider a general class of weak, energy-level solutions and
opens the possibility to study energy quantization and finite-time
singularities. We restrict in this first work to a small-energy regime and
prove that, for small-energy weak immersions, the Cauchy problem in this class
admits a unique solution.
