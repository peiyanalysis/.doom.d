<p>Persistence diagrams, an important summary in topological data analysis,
consist of a set of ordered pairs, each with positive multiplicity. Persistence
diagrams are obtained via Mobius inversion and may be compared using a
one-parameter family of metrics called Wasserstein distances. In certain cases,
Mobius inversion produces sets of ordered pairs which may have negative
multiplicity. We call these virtual persistence diagrams. Divol and Lacombe
recently showed that there is a Wasserstein distance for Radon measures on the
half plane of ordered pairs that generalizes both the Wasserstein distance for
persistence diagrams and the classical Wasserstein distance from optimal
transport theory. Following this work, we define compatible Wasserstein
distances for persistence diagrams and Radon measures on arbitrary metric
spaces. Furthermore, we show that the 1-Wasserstein distance extends to virtual
persistence diagrams and to signed measures. In addition, we characterize the
Cauchy completion of persistence diagrams on metric spaces with respect to the
Wasserstein distances.
