<p>We study the steady planar Euler flow in a bounded simply connected domain,
where the vortex function is $f=t_+^p$ with $p&gt;0$ and the vorticity strength is
prescribed. By studying the location and local uniqueness of vortices, we prove
that the vorticity method and the stream function method actually give the same
solution. We also show that if the vorticity of flow is located near an
isolated minimum point and non-degenerate critical point of the Kirchhoff-Routh
function, it must be stable in the nonlinear sense.
