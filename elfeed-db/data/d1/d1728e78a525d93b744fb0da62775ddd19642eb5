<p>In the current work we study a stochastic parabolic problem. The underlying
problem is actually motivated by the study of an idealized electrically
actuated MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) device in the case of random
fluctuations of the potential difference controlling the device.

<p>We first present the mathematical model and then we deduce some local
existence results. Next for some particular versions of the model, regarding
its boundary conditions, we derive quenching results as well as estimations of
the probability for such singularity to occur. Additional numerical study of
the problem in one dimension follows, investigating the problem further with
respect to its quenching behaviour.
