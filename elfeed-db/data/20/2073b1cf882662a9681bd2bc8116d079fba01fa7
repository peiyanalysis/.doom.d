<p>We consider the topic of linearization of finite elasticity for pure traction
problems. We characterize the variational limit for the approximating sequence
of rescaled nonlinear elastic energies. We show that the limiting minimal value
can be strictly lower than the minimal value of the standard linear elastic
energy if a strict compatibility condition for external loads does not hold.
The results are provided for both the compressible and the incompressible case.
