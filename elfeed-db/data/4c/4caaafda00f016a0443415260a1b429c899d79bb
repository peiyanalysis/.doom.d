<p>In this work, we propose a new analysis strategy to establish an a priori
estimate of the weak solutions to the coupled steady-state
dual-porosity-Navier-Stokes fluid flow model with the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman
interface condition. The most advantage of our proposed method is that the a
priori estimate and the existence result are independent of small data and the
large viscosity restriction. Therefore the global uniqueness of the weak
solution is naturally obtained.
