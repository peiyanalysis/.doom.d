<p>The group properties of the shallow-water equations with the complete
Coriolis force is the subject of this study. In particular we apply the Lie
theory to classify the system of three nonlinear partial differential equations
according to the admitted Lie point symmetries. For each case of the
classification problem the one-dimensional optimal system is determined. The
results are applied for the derivation of new similarity solutions.
