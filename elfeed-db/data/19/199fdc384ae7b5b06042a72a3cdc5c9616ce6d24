<p>The optimal visiting problem is the optimization of a trajectory that has to
touch or pass as close as possible to a collection of target points. The
problem does not verify the dynamic programming principle, and it needs a
specific formulation to keep track of the visited target points. In this paper,
we discuss a hybrid control-based approach where the discontinuous part of the
trajectory switches between a group of discrete states related to the targets
of the problem. After introducing the problem, we show the well-position
establishing a correspondence with a collection of time-dependent optimal
stopping problems.
