<p>We investigate the Bi-Laplacian with Wentzell boundary conditions in a
bounded domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ with Lipschitz boundary $\Gamma$.
More precisely, using form methods, we show that the associated operator on the
ground space $L^2(\Omega)\times L^2(\Gamma)$ has compact resolvent and
generates a holomorphic and strongly continuous real semigroup of self-adjoint
operators. Furthermore, we give a full characterization of the domain in terms
of Sobolev spaces, also proving H\"older regularity of solutions, allowing
classical interpretation of the boundary condition. Finally, we investigate
spectrum and asymptotic behavior of the semigroup, as well as eventual
positivity.
