<p>We prove global existence backwards from the scattering data posed at
infinity for the Maxwell Klein Gordon equations in Lorenz gauge satisfying the
weak null condition. The asymptotics of the solutions to the Maxwell Klein
Gordon equations in Lorenz gauge were shown to be wave like at null infinity
and homogeneous towards timelike infinity in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11086" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arXiv:1803.11086</a> and expressed in
terms of radiation fields, and thus our scattering data will be given in the
form of radiation fields in the backward problem. We give a refinement of the
asymptotics results in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11086" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arXiv:1803.11086</a>, and then making use of this
refinement, we find a global solution which attains the prescribed scattering
data at infinity. Our result corresponds to "existence of scattering states" in
the scattering theory. The method of proof relies on a suitable construction of
the approximate solution from the scattering data, a weighted conformal
Morawetz energy estimate and a spacetime version of Hardy inequality.
