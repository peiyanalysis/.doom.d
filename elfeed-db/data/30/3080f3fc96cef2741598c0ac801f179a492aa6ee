<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>We compute the nuclear dimension of separable, simple, unital, nuclear, <span>
                    
                    <span>\({\mathcal {Z}}\)</span>
                    
                  </span>-stable <span>
                    
                    <span>\(\mathrm {C}^*\)</span>
                    
                  </span>-algebras. This makes classification accessible from <span>
                    
                    <span>\({\mathcal {Z}}\)</span>
                    
                  </span>-stability and in particular brings large classes of <span>
                    
                    <span>\(\mathrm {C}^*\)</span>
                    
                  </span>-algebras associated to free and minimal actions of amenable groups on finite dimensional spaces within the scope of the Elliott classification programme.</p>
