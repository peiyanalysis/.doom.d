<p>In this paper, we study a reaction-diffusion-advection system which
characterizes the interactions between the predator and prey in advective
environments, such as streams or rivers. We extend some results in \cite{NWW}
to the corresponding system with a heterogeneous intrinsic growth rate or a
heterogeneous carrying capacity of the prey. More precisely, it turns out that
there exist four critical mortality rates of the predator and two critical
advection rates, which classify the dynamic behavior of this system into some
scenarios, such as, (i) both populations go extinct; (ii) the predator can not
invade and the prey survives in the long run. We point out that compared to
homogeneous intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity, the case in this paper
is more complicated.
