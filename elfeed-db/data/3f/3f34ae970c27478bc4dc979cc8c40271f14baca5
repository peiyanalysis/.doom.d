<p>We analyze the $kq$-based motivic Adams spectral sequence over the complex
numbers, where $kq$ is the very effective cover of Hermitian K-theory defined
over $\mathbb{C}$ by Isaksen-Shkembi and over general base fields by
Ananyevskiy-R{\"o}ndigs-{\O}stv{\ae}r. We calculate the ring of cooperations of
$kq$ modulo $v_1$-torsion, completely calculate the $0$- and $1$-lines of the
$kq$-resolutions, completely determine the $v_1$-periodic complex motivic
stable stems, and recover Andrews and Miller's computation of the
$\eta$-periodic complex motivic stable stems. As an application, we propose a
motivic Telescope Conjecture and outline a program for proving the conjecture
in two cases using our calculations. We also propose a model for the complex
motivic stable orthogonal J-homomorphism and conjecture its location in the
$kq$-resolution.
