<p>We establish the existence and uniqueness, in bounded as well as unbounded
Lipschitz type cylinders of the forms $U_X\times V_{Y,t}$ and $\Omega\times
\mathbb R^{m}\times \mathbb R$, of weak solutions to Cauchy-Dirichlet problems
for the strongly degenerate parabolic operator \[ \mathcal{L}:=
\nabla_X\cdot(A(X,Y,t)\nabla_X)+X\cdot\nabla_Y-\partial_t, \] assuming that
$A=A(X,Y,t)=\{a_{i,j}(X,Y,t)\}$ is a real $m\times m$-matrix valued, measurable
function such that $A(X,Y,t)$ is symmetric, bounded and uniformly elliptic.
Subsequently we solve the continuous Dirichlet problem and establish the
representation of the solution using associated parabolic measures. The paper
is motivated, through our recent studies, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03654" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arXiv:2012.03654</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04278" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arXiv:2012.04278</a>,
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07446" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arXiv:2012.07446</a>, by a growing need and interest to gain a deeper understanding
of the Dirichlet problem for the operator $\mathcal{L}$ in Lipschitz type
domains. The key idea underlying our results is to prove, along the lines of
Brezis and Ekeland, and in particular following the recent work of S. Armstrong
and J-C. Mourrat, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04037" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arXiv:1902.04037</a>, concerning variational methods for the
kinetic Fokker-Planck equation, that the solution can be obtained as the
minimizer of a uniformly convex functional.
