<p>We consider a Fokker-Planck operator with electric potential and
electromagnetic fields. We establish the sharp weighted and subelliptic
estimates, involving the control of the derivatives of electric potential and
electromagnetic fields. Our proof relies on a localization argument as well as
a careful calculation on commutators.
