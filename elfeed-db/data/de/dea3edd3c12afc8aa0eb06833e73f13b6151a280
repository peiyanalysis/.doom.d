<p>The persistent homology of random processes has been a question of interest
in the TDA community. This paper aims to extend a result of Chazal and Divol
and to reconcile the probabilistic approach to the study of the topology of
superlevel sets of random processes in dimension 1. We provide explicit
descriptions of the barcode for Brownian motion and the Brownian bridge.
Additionally, we use these results on almost surely $C^0$-processes to describe
the barcodes of sequences which admit these objects as limits, up to some
quantifiable error.
