<p>In this paper we propose a computationally efficient multiple hypothesis
testing procedure for persistence homology. Most current approaches to
hypothesis testing using persistence homology is based on resampling or
permutation procedures, this is because there exists little distribution theory
that provides a natural null model for persistence diagrams. In this paper we
propose a null model based based approach to testing for acyclicity, coupled
with a Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) control method that does not suffer from
the computational costs associated to resampling and permutation based
approaches. We adapt standard False Discovery Rate (FDR) control procedures to
the topological setting, and use our null model for hypothesis testing using
persistent homology. A key idea in our paper is that one can compute an
empirical distribution under a null hypothesis model that can be used for
hypothesis testing in the same way that a normal or t-distribution is used in
classical statistics. A argument for the use of this empirical null is based on
simulations and limit theorems for persistent homology for point processes.
