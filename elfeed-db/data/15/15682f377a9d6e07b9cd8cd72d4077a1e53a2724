<p>In this paper we study the regularity of the non-cutoff
Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system for plasma particles of two species in the
whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$ with hard potential. The existence of global-in-time
nearby Maxwellian solutions is known for soft potential from [15]. However the
smoothing effect of these solutions has been a challenging open problem. We
establish the global existence and regularizing effect to the Cauchy problem
for hard potential with large time decay. Hence, the solutions are smooth with
respect to $(t,x,v)$ for any positive time $t&gt;0$. This gives the regularity to
Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system, which enjoys a similar smoothing effect as
Boltzmann equation. The proof is based on the time-weighted energy method
building also upon the pseudo-differential calculus.
