<p>In this note, we prove scale-invariant Strichartz estimates
$$\|e^{it\Delta}f\|_{L^p(I\times M)}\lesssim \|f\|_{H^{d/2-(d+2)/p}(M)}$$ on
any compact globally symmetric space $M$ equipped with the canonical Killing
metric, for all $p\geq 2+8/r$, $d,r$ being respectively the dimension and rank
of $M$. This generalizes the previous results on compact Lie groups. The proof
relies on an integral formula discovered by J.-L. Clerc for spherical functions
on symmetric spaces of compact type.
