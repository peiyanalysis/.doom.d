<p>We study a class of critical Kirchhoff problems with a general nonlocal term.
The main difficulty here is the absence of a closed-form formula for the
compactness threshold. First we obtain a variational characterization of this
threshold level. Then we prove a series of existence and multiplicity results
based on this variational characterization.
